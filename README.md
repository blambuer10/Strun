 🚀 Overview

STRUN is a move-to-earn platform built on **Solana**, combining **AI**, GPS tracking**, and **blockchain verification** to reward real physical activity with tangible value.

Users can complete personalized tasks generated by AI, participate in local or sponsored challenges, and earn XP and SOL rewards.  
Each verified running route can even be minted as a Land NFT — making movement collectible.


 🎯 The Problem

Traditional fitness apps track data but fail to motivate users or offer real rewards.  
Users quickly lose interest, and brands or event organizers have no effective way to engage users through real-world challenges.



💡 The STRUN Solution

STRUN builds a gamified ecosystem where:

- Users earn real rewards for completing AI-verified physical tasks  
- Sponsors and local businesses can create location-based challenges  
- Each activity becomes a verifiable on-chain record
